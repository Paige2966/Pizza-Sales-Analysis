## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered
      1. What are our best- and worst-performing pizzas by revenue and quantity?
      2. Which days and times drive the most sales?
      3. How do different pizza sizes and categories contribute to total revenue?
      4. What are our busiest and slowest months—and why?
      5. Are there customer behavior trends we can leverage for targeted promotions?

## 🔑 Key Insights
      1. Top Performers:
          - The BBQ Chicken Pizza (Large) and Classic Deluxe (XL) contributed 23% of total revenue.
          - Meat and Classic categories consistently outsold Veggie and Chicken pizzas.

      2.  Sales Trends:
          - Fridays and Saturdays are peak sales days, with 6 PM – 8 PM being the top-performing time slots.
          - December and July are the highest-grossing months, likely tied to holidays and events.

      3. Low Performers:
          - Small and Medium Veggie Pizzas consistently underperformed across the year.
          - Morning hours (8 AM–11 AM) showed minimal activity, representing an opportunity for upselling breakfast-related items if expanded.
      
      4.  Seasonal Patterns:
          - Sales dipped in February and August, indicating potential seasonality or low campaign performance.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
      1. Focus Marketing on Peak Hours:
      
          - Push SMS/email promotions between 4 PM–6 PM on Thurs–Sat to maximize dinner rush sales.
      
      2. Bundle & Upsell Strategy:
      
          - Create combo deals featuring high-margin items like BBQ Chicken XL and sides (tracked separately).
          - Consider removing or rebranding low-performing SKUs (e.g., Small Veggie Pizzas).
      
      3. Event-Driven Campaigns:
      
          - Plan promotions around high-performing months (July, December), leveraging national holidays and events.
      
      4. Size Optimization:
      
          - Promote Large and XL pizzas which represent higher revenue per unit. Offer loyalty points or “Buy 4 get 1 Free” to encourage bulk buying.
      
      5. Operational Adjustments:
      
          - Increase staffing during Friday/Saturday evenings and offer delivery promos to ease dine-in volume.
